# Projects related to Closure Compiler (feel free to suggest additions for this page).

[Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/) - An implementation of JavaScript written in Java. Closure Compiler uses an fork of an old version of Rhino as our AST.

### Build Tools that use Closure Compiler

[ClosureCompiler.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/ClosureCompiler.js) - A package for running Closure Compiler under Node.js

[Closure Javascript Framework](https://github.com/jlgrock/ClosureJavascriptFramework) - A Maven plugin for running Closure Compiler on JavaScript code.

[Closure Script](https://github.com/dturnbull/closure-script) - Build tools for recompiling JavaScript on refresh and showing warnings in the browser's console. Provides good Ruby bindings.

[este](https://github.com/Steida/este) - JavaScript Framework and Dev Stack build on Google Closure Tools with CoffeeScript support

[JSlim](https://github.com/zgrossbart/jslim) - Builds optimized versions of common library code.

[Plovr](http://plovr.com/) - A server for recompiling JavaScript on the fly with Closure Compiler, for rapid development. Also tries to make it easy to get started with Closure Library and Templates.

[Relief](http://code.google.com/p/relief/) - A Rails-like Framework to help you set up a lot of the boilerplate of a Closure-based project and get coding quickly.

[Web Resource Optimizer for Java](http://code.google.com/p/wro4j/) - A Java API that makes it easier to serve and minimize resources. Supports many different tools, including Closure Compiler, UglifyJs, YUI, CoffeeScript, and more.

[silksmith](https://github.com/silksmith/silksmith) - A Gradle Plugin that manages dependencies via Maven, configures the compile task and comes with a buildin development server and a Mocha based test runner.

### Other Languages that Compile to JavaScript

[ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) - An implementation of Lisp that compiles down to JavaScript compatible with Closure Compiler's advanced mode. 

[emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) - A LLVM to JavaScript cross compiler that optionally uses Closure Compiler's advanced mode to reduce code size.

[Google Web Toolkit](https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/) - A Java to JavaScript tool set that optionally uses the Closure Compiler to further reduce code size.
