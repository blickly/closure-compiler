RefasterJS is a tool for refactoring JavaScript that leverages the Closure Compiler's AST and type information to make refactoring easier. Developers write a JavaScript template to tell the tool what code to change and how it should be changed. More information can be found at the [RefasterJS documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14-rsX1-VoTN2lpFalbwr4_yupxXYW-qNYn2XGVvhLwE/view).
